            In the last few years I've been focusing more and more on building
            and delivering educational content around data & data visualisation.

            - this is a 2-year program focused on creating the next batch of
            great data analysts. At the Dataschool I teach various topics,
            ranging from 'Working with APIs' to 'Introduction to Regular
            Expressions'.
          </p>
          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            I also regularly blog and work on web development and creative
            coding projects. This is often in relation to Tableau and Alteryx.
            Although I don't really like to use the word 'developer'. To me this
            sounds a bit like I'm stuck in a basement coding all day ðŸ¤“. That's
            not really what I do. I mainly use web technologies to help others
            be successful with Tableau & Alteryx. My front-end framework of
            choice is React and I'm also using D3.js if I feel up for it. Early
            on in my career I focused on Python but in the last few years I
            primarily write JavaScript. If you want to get a sense of what I
            create, then head over to my{" "}

          <h3>Teaching</h3>
          <p>
            I have designed and delivered a whole host of training sessions in
            more than 10 countries across four continents. In 2019 alone I
            taught Tableau and Alteryx to more than a 1000 people. The training
            content ranges from introducing Tableau & Alteryx to specific topics
            such as using APIs and web development related topics.
