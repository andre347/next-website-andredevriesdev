          <p>
            During my career I have helped hundreds of companies, many of those
            firms in the Fortune 500. I have also designed and delivered a whole
            host of training sessions in more than 10 countries across four
            continents. In 2019 alone I taught Tableau and Alteryx to more than
            a 1000 people. The training content ranges from introducing Tableau
            & Alteryx to specific topics such as using APIs and web development
            related topics.
