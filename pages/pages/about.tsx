          <p>
            During my career I have helped hundreds of companies getting into
            the Modern Data Stack, many of those firms in the Fortune 500. I
            have also designed and delivered a whole host of training sessions
            in more than 10 countries across four continents. In 2019 alone I
            taught Tableau and Alteryx to more than a 1000 people in person. The
            training content ranges from introducing Tableau & Alteryx to
            specific topics such as using APIs and web development related
            topics. Currently at The Information Lab I advise customers who want
            to build and architect public-facing data apps and want to monetise
            their BI and data insights.
