### On the 8th of March 2019 I gave a talk for the [Tableau EMEA Fringe Festival](https://www.thefringefestival.rocks) about Tableau Extensions. I've just got around creating a quick blog post about it. In this talk I spoke about what Tableau Extensions are, why you should use them and how you can create them.

In the talk of about 20 minutes I introduced my journey of how I learned creating Tableau Extensions. I then also spoke about What they are, How you can create them and also Why you should get excited about creating them.
