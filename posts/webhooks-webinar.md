title: "Talk! New in Tableau: Trigger Events with Webhooks"
date: "2020-01-22"
template: post
draft: false
description: In version 2019.4 Tableau released the ability to use webhooks in the platform. With webhooks you are able to integrate Tableau events in your own applications. An example could be a message in your Slack work space when a new workbook was published or a text message to your boss when an extract fails (options are endless). In this webinar my colleague Laine Caruzca and I went over how to configure these web hooks and how to use no-code solutions such as Zapier and IFTTT. Go to 'Read' to check out the recording!
